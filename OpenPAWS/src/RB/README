- The scripts assume you are using Mikrotik RouterBoard 433AH (This is relevant for the wireless interface.
If you are using any other version of Mikrotik RouterBoard, change the wireless interface name from wlan0 
to wlanx (x is the wireless interface name in your Mikrotik RouterBoard) in all the script files (files with
extension .sh) 
- Complete the initial setup by executing the file install.sh (./install.sh master OR ./install.sh slave)
- Reboot the system
- Access the PAWS configuration page from the broswer (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/PAWS.php)
  Here, xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is your RouterBoard's IP Address.
- Sample PAWS Server IP Address can be obtained from "www.ee.iitb.ac.in/tvws/PAWS_server_ip.txt"
